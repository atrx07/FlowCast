# FlowCast

FlowCast is an end-to-end traffic forecasting and congestion-intelligence
project for the 25-segment Northline Corridor. It is being built as a
reproducible Python 3.11 pipeline with a Streamlit dashboard.

For each road segment, FlowCast will forecast the next 30, 60, 90, and 120
minutes of traffic volume, average speed, congestion class, travel time, and
accident risk, together with prediction confidence. The finished system will
combine validated traffic, weather, and calendar data with classical machine
learning and a from-scratch recurrent neural network.

## Current status

Milestone M1 is complete. The repository can preserve and verify the delivered
raw files, audit their quality, enforce executable data contracts, resolve
duplicate keys deterministically, and persist validated and quarantined rows
with source-level lineage. Cleaning, feature engineering, modelling, and the
dashboard are later milestones; the current outputs are not model-ready.

## Quick start

Python 3.11 is required.

```powershell
py -3.11 -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -e ".[test]"
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m flowcast.cli audit
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m flowcast.cli validate
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest -q
```

On macOS or Linux, use `.venv/bin/python` in place of the Windows interpreter
path.

The source documents and delivered CSV files remain read-only in
`FlowCast-project_file/`. Byte-identical working copies belong in `data/raw/`;
versioned validated data and issue records are written beneath `data/interim/`
and `data/quarantine/`.

See `PROJECT.md` for the product contract, `ARCHITECTURE.md` for the system
design, `TECH_STACK.md` for approved technologies, and `STATUS.md` /
`NEXT_STEP.md` for verified progress and the immediate build step.
